# Hangman Game  

### Description  
Hangman is a classic word-guessing game reimagined as a fun, interactive website. Players try to guess a hidden word by selecting letters, but bewareâ€”you only have 8 wrong guesses before the game ends!  

This game is built using **HTML**, **CSS**, **JavaScript**, and **JSON** and is fully responsive, making it accessible on both desktop and mobile devices.  

One of the things that made me make this project is to enhance my skills in drawing by before and after without using images or any thing else. I want to to make it better by implementing the features of dark and light themes toggling and some others as a practice of constructing responsive, beautiful projects before start learing other skills of frontEnd like TypeScript, react and other frameworks.
